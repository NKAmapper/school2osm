# school2osm
Extracts schools from the Norwegian National School Register (NSR).

### Usage ###

<code>python school2osm.py [outfile.osm]</code>

### Notes ###

* This program extracts primary, secondary and high schools from the National School Register (NSR) by the Norwegian Directorate for Education and Training, and produces an OSM file with all schools; approx. 4000 public and private schools for the whole country of Norway.
* NSR is collecting data from the [Central Register of Establishments and Enterprises](https://www.brreg.no/produkter-og-tjenester/apne-data/opplysninger-om-virksomheter/) as well as from other sources, such as [GSI](https://gsi.udir.no/app/#!/view/units/collectionset/1/collection/80/unit/1/). Data quality ultimatly depends on input from each school or county.
  * Coordinates without a proper address (street + house number) are very rough (postal code accuracy).
  * Schools without _capacity_ or _website_ may not be in operation yetâ€”you may want to consult indexed search engines to discover their status.
  * A few schools are in fact just administrative offices and should not be imported to OSM.
* The directorate recommends extrating data outside of normal business hours to get a consistent data set.
* Use [update2osm](https://github.com/osmno/update2osm) to discover differences wrt. schools currently in OSM, and to get an OSM file ready for inspection and uploading, based on the _ref:udir_nsr_ tag.
